# CodeToolbox

This repository is a collection of small scripts and functions that I use and reuse in various projects. 

## Contents

Here's a brief overview of what you'll find in the CodeToolbox:

- **model_screener.py:** The Model Screener is a Python utility that facilitates the screening of machine learning models by evaluating their performance with standard hyperparameters and generating a summary report.
- **reverse_complement.py:** Computes the reverse complement of a DNA sequence and returns that transformed sequence as a string.
- **fasta_reader.py:** Reads DNA sequences from a FASTA file and returns a dictionary of sequence identifiers and sequences.
- **codon_mapper.py:** Translates nucleotide sequences to amino acid sequences. Does not reverse the sequence!
